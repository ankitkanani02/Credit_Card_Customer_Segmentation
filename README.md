# Credit_Card_Customer_Segmentation

The project "Credit_Card_Customer_Segmentation" is a data analysis and clustering project that aims to identify customer segments based on credit card data. The project utilizes Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly, and yellowbrick for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Introduction
The project focuses on analyzing credit card data to uncover patterns and segment customers. By applying clustering techniques, the goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences for targeted marketing strategies or personalized services.

## Data Preprocessing
The project starts by loading the credit card dataset and performing data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values. This ensures the data is clean and ready for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This step helps in understanding the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and exploring relationships between features.

## Clustering
The features used for clustering are selected, and data scaling is applied using the MinMaxScaler. This ensures that all features are on a similar scale and prevents certain features from dominating the clustering process.

Next, the project determines the optimal number of clusters using the "elbow method" for K-means clustering. This helps in identifying a suitable number of clusters that best represent the underlying structure of the data. A hierarchical clustering dendrogram is also plotted to provide an alternative perspective on cluster formation.

The project applies K-means clustering and assigns each data point to a specific cluster. The resulting clusters are labeled as "Cluster 2" and "Cluster 3" based on the mapping provided. The data is visualized using a 3D scatter plot, where each point represents a customer and is colored according to its assigned cluster.

Furthermore, the project explores the application of Agglomerative Clustering to the dataset, again using three clusters. The resulting clusters are labeled similarly to the K-means clustering approach.

## Results
The clustering analysis reveals distinct customer segments within the credit card dataset. These segments provide insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.

## Conclusion
The "Credit_Card_Customer_Segmentation" project demonstrates the use of clustering techniques to identify customer segments based on credit card data. By analyzing and understanding these segments, businesses can make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction, tailor marketing campaigns, and optimize service offerings.
